    <h1>Purple Pen Change Summary</h1>

    <h2>Changes in 3.5.2</h2>
    <h3>New/Changed Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can now install Purple Pen via the Microsoft Store. This is the recommended way to install Purple Pen on Windows 10 or 11.
            This is a safer and faster way to install Purple Pen, and it will automatically update Purple Pen when new versions are available.
        </li>
        <li>
            Courses now include a "do not include in reports" check box. When checked, this 
            course will not be include in reports. Additionally, the course will not be listed when showing 
            which courses a control or leg is used in.
        </li>
        <li>
            When printed, headers in reports will be repeated on the second and subsequent pages.
            This is most useful for the control cross-reference report.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.5.1</h2>
    <h3>New/Changed Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The "Triangle inside a circle" symbol is used for map exchanges at a control or map flips.
            (You must be using ISOM 2017 or ISSprOM 2019 map standard.)
        </li>
        <li>
            There is now an option for using the Arial font for control numbers. Although Roboto remains
            the default, and I believe Roboto is easier to read (especially distinguishing the digits 5 and 6, 6 and 8, 9 and 8),
            Arial is now an option for those who desire strict adherance to ISSOM 2017 standard in this regard.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            UK and Australian English did not show the name of the "Trench" symbol. (Thanks to
            Tony Simpkins for this report.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.5.0</h2>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In certain rare circumstances, creating an image object would have the
            wrong aspect ratio. (Thanks to Sergio Rezzonico for this report.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.5.0 Beta 1</h2>
    <h3>New/Changed Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Run in full resolution on high resolution displays. When running on screens with a resolution about 120 dpi, Purple Pen will
            use the full resolution of the display, instead of being scaled (which results in a slight fuzziness).
        </li>
        <li>
            New feature: Event/Move all controls. Allows moving all the controls (and other course features) to handle offsets,
            rotations, or scaling of the underlying map file.
        </li>
        <li>
            New description symbols from the IOF Control Descriptions Standard 2024. Adds Railway and Map Flip. Because the
            2024 standard is the same as the 2018 except the two new symbols, the 2024 standard is merged with the 2018 standard
            when selecting which control standard to use.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added program translation for Czech, Danish, Portuguese, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Traditional Chinese.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fix in importing UTM zones from OpenOrienteering Mapper files, if they did not
            contain a 'N' or 'S' at the end of the zone.
        </li>
        <li>
            Correctly handle embedded layout images and hidden layouts in OCAD files.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Changes in 3.4.1</h2>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fix for regression: PDFs did not contain the control descriptions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fix for regression: when both control number white borders and blending of the purple color were both enabled,
            the control number should not be blended.
        </li>
        <li>
            Updated the appearance of Out Of Bounds Area for ISSprOM 2019-2 standard.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.4.0</h2>
    <h3>New/Changed Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Add KML export
        </li>
        <li>
            Added ISSpr2019 to map standards
        </li>
        <li>
            Add option to show control label of score only
        </li>
        <li>
            Can now import geo-referenced templates in OpenOrienteering mapper files
        </li>
        <li>
            Add support for additional Czech map projection
        </li>
        <li>
            OpenOrienteering mapper files now support overprint effect for specific color layers
        </li>
        <li>
            Better handling of georeferencing for projects with Grid Scale Factor not equal to 1.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Several bugs fixed in ready OpenOrienteering Mapper files.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixed bug in white around control numbers
        </li>
        <li>
            Correct set randomOrder attribute in V3 XML export for score courses
        </li>
        <li>
            Change default Purple color to match ISOM standard
        </li>
        <li>
            Probably other bug fixes I forgot.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.3.0</h2>
    <h3>New/Changed Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Supports reading and writing OpenOrienteering Mapper files from version 0.9.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added a new Add/Ellipse menu item to add an ellipse/circle to a course.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added a new Item/Stretch menu item that can be used to stretch a crossing point
            feature to cross a longer distance.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Better loading of Roboto fonts from private files to prevent problems when old versions
            of the Roboto fonts are installed on a machine.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.2.3</h2>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Many times, the File/Create Image Files command would fail with a NullReferenceException
        </li>
        <li>
            Text objects with an uninstalled font could cause a crash.
        </li>
        <li>
            Problem with the localization in Chinese that would prevent startup fixed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.2.2</h2>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In certain rare cases, creating a PDF would cause an "Out Of Memory" error, even though
            it was not out of memory at all. (Thanks to Matti Tahvonen for reporting this.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Changing "assign fixed legs to branches" from the Relay Team Variations often did not
            save changes (thanks to Richard Payne for reporting this.)
        </li>
        <li>
            The gaps in control circles did not handle different print scales in different courses
            if "scale item sizes" was set to "relative to map scale" or "relative to 1:15,000"
            (thanks to Christophe for noticing this.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.2.1</h2>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In certain rare cases, an old version of "Roboto Thin" already installed on a computer would
            cause the wrong font to be used for control number. This version fixes that problem.
            (Thanks to David Rosen for noticing and helping to debug this problem.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.2.0</h2>
    <h3>New/Changed features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A new font is now used for the control descriptions, and also for numbers on the map. This font
            has a more current look, and also has better digits "6" and "9" that are less likely to be confused for an "8".
            The font is "Roboto" and "Roboto Condensed", and is installed automatically when Purple Pen is installed.
        </li>
        <li>
            A new command, File/Create Image Files..., allows you to create PNG, JPEG, or GIF images from your courses.
            Optionally, the images can be georeferenced with world files.
        </li>
        <li>
            Two new commands: File/Create PDFs/Descriptions and File/Create PDFs/Punch Cards allow you to create PDFs of the
            description sheets or master punch cards. This is easier than using a PDF print driver.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Add/Text command allows explicitly setting a text size.
        </li>
        <li>
            The File/Create RouteGadget files command now exports a world file along with the GIF file (if the underlying map is georeferenced) so that
            RouteGadget understands the georeferencing. Also, the RouteGadget image now includes the entire print area.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Add/Map Issue Point has been renamed to Add/Timed Start to better reflect its correct purpose. The command
            now allows you to place the map issue point at the beginning, middle, or end of a marked route from the timed start
            to the start triangle. (Thanks to David Rosen for clarifying this.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Purple Pen now correctly reads all kinds of georeferencing from OpenOrienteering Mapper (previously only UTM
            georeferencing worked).
        </li>
        <li>
            Two new special texts are available for the Add/Text command: $(FileName) for the Purple Pen file name, and $(MapFileName)
            for the map file name.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can now used fixed branches within nested forks when creating relay variations.
        </li>
        <li>
            When using relay variations, the variation code can be hidden from the control descriptions on the map.
        </li>
        <li>
            When printing courses, the rasterize option that used to be present (and on by default) is no longer an option -- it
            is always used.
        </li>
        <li>
            The web site now has a "Learn" section with links to videos and other resources for helping to learn Purple Pen.
            If you have materials that would be useful for this section, please let me know!
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Control circles with gaps in them are now exported to OpenOrienteering Mapper correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some fixes were made in reading georeferenced OCAD maps for some less commonly used map projections.
        </li>
        <li>
            Several fixes were made for relays that include map exchanges. (Thanks to John Ockenden for reporting these.)
        </li>
        <li>
            The algorithm for distributing relay variations among teams has been revised to better distribute
            legs among team members. Thanks to Eric Harper for reporting this bug.
        </li>
        <li>
            OCAD produces PDF files that are not correctly formatted according to the PDF specification. In certain
            rare cases, this caused Purple Pen to hang when creating PDF files with such a PDF as the map file. The
            PDF reading code was updated to not be susceptible to such incorrect PDF files. Thanks to Ian Jessup for
            providing an example of this issue.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.1.6</h2>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Relay teams where the starting bib number was not 1 had problem when trying to print courses or descriptions and
            selecting print "each relay leg separately". Thanks to Eric Halper for reporting this bug.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.1.5</h2>
    <h3>Changed features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can now specify a starting bib number for relay variations.</li>
        <li>Objects such as text or images that overlay a white-out area can now be easily selected.</li>
        <li>Textual control descriptions in Italian are now available (thank you to Lorenzo Pinna, Dario D'Amico, Davide Denardis)</li>
        <li>Column A is blank in a score course if sequence numbers are not placed on the map.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When exporting IOF XML version 3.0, the class names weren't exported.</li>
        <li>When exporting relay variations to IOF XML 3.0, the last relay team wasn't exported.</li>
        <li>Adding a new localization language for description text didn't work.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug computing the print area on a blank course.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.1.4</h2>
    <h3>Changed features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Due to licensing issues, the setup program has been rewritten.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug loading OpenOrienteering Mapper files that were converted from georeferenced OCAD files. (Thanks to miyakawa_to)</li>
        <li>Fixed bug adding start to an existing course. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.1.3</h2>
    <h3>New features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Supports loading files created with OCAD 2018.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed the size of the finish symbol when ISOM2017 is selected. (Thanks to ezzrezzoni for spotting this!)</li>
        <li>No longer draws OpenOrienteering Mapper symbols marked as helper symbols. (Thanks to Sverre Froyen.) </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.1.2</h2>
    <h3>New features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Contains the first implementation of a feature to view other courses at the same time as your current course. I am
            interested in feedback on this feature. Try it out using View/Other Courses menu item.
        </li>
        <li>
            Image objects (added with Add/Image) now appear above other Purple Pen objects, including white-out areas. Note that
            when exporting to OCAD version 10 or below, this layering will not be preserved due to limitations of the OCAD file format.
            You will receive a warning when this occurs.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Can now load files saved by the recently released OpenOrienteering Mapper 0.8.0.</li>

        <li>Improved the conversion of CMYK to RGB colors so that 100% K converts to all black. (Thanks to Ove Baardsgaard for reporting this.)</li>
        <li>Tooltips now appear on all controls if View/All Controls is selected.</li>
        <li>A warning appears when exporting to OCAD 8 or lower format and the base map contains templates. (Thanks to Mike Godfree for reporting this.)</li>
        <li>A fix for font names in OCAD files containing Japanese characters (Thanks to miyakawa_to@yahoo.co.jp for reporting this.)</li>
        <li>When exported to OpenOrienteering Mapper format, image objects may have been layered incorrectly.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Changes in 3.1.1</h2>
    <h3>New features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A new, modern web site at http://purple-pen.org.  Thanks to Eric Golde for designing and coding this.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix bug in Event Audit when used with the 2018 control description standard bend symbol. (Thank you David Rosen for reporting this.)</li>
        <li>Fix some missing help topics.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Changes in 3.1.0</h2>
    <h3>New features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Now supports the 2018 control description standards. When creating an event, you have the choice as to which
            control description standard to use. You can also switch an event from the 2000 standard to the 2018 standard by using the
            Event/IOF Standards menu item.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now supports the ISOM 2017 map standard. The control circles are slightly smaller, and the shapes and sizes of
            items are slightly different. The out of bound area is hatched differently.
        </li>
        <li>
            In Event/Customize Appearance, you can now change whether control circles and lines scale with the map when
            printing at different map scales.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can now add an "Map Issue Point" before the start. The distance from the map issue point to the start is included
            in the length of the course, and the map issue point is denoted with a cross bar and dashed line to the start, as described
            in ISOM 2017.
        </li>
        <li>The map display is updated faster and with less flicker.</li>
        <li>OCAD 12 new structured area options are now displayed correctly. These are used in the OCAD 12 templates for ISOM 2017.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.0.1</h2>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix exceptions that occur when dragging or deleting controls in certain cases.</li>
        <li>Record both absolute and relative paths of map file into the Purple Pen file so moving Purple Pen file works better (thanks to Mark Roberts for report).</li>
        <li>Fix bug loading certain OpenOrienteering Mapper files.</li>
        <li>Correct error message when attempting to load old format OpenOrienteering Mapper file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.0.0</h2>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Several issues in loading OpenOrienteering Mapper files were fixed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.0.0 Beta 4</h2>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixed: In some cases, when creating PDF files, and the base map file is a PDF, files after the first one
            would be blank. (Thanks to Gordon Bossley for reporting the problem.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.0.0 Beta 3</h2>
    <h3>New features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Course Variations and Relays</strong></p>
            <p>
                Finish up support through the program. All reports now handle variations correctly. Course summary shows the length of every variation.
                Creating OCAD Files handles variations correctly.
            </p>
            <p>IOF XML export now includes leg assignments for relays if those have been defined.</p>
            <p>
                When defining relay team assignments, you can assign specific legs to specific branches. For example, if there are four branches
                and four legs, you could assign leg 4 to always run branch D, and have legs 1, 2, 3 vary among branches A, B, C.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                White out, lines, images, text, and all special objects can now be specifically added or removed from the all
                controls view.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>

    <h2>Changes in 3.0.0 Beta 2</h2>
    <h3>New features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Course Variations and Relays</strong></p>
            <p>
                Fix significant bugs that cause relay courses to sometimes not appear. Better flexibility for rearranging and inserting
                controls in the control ordering view. Better support in reports.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>64-bit Support</strong></p>
            <p>
                Purple Pen now runs in 64-bit mode on 64-bit operating systems. You do not need to select a separate 64-bit installation;
                the installer installs 32-bit and 64-bit support. On 64-bit operating systems, Purple Pen will be able to load larger
                bitmaps and PDFs (up to 500 megapixels) without running out of memory.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Numerous bug fixes. More detail to come.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 3.0.0 Beta 1</h2>
    <h3>New features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Open Orienteering Mapper Files</strong></p>
            <p>
                Purple Pen now allows an Open Orienteering Mapper file (.xmap or .omap) to be used as the base map for course design.
                You can also export your course designs to a new Open Orienteering Mapper file. All Open Orienteering Mapper maps
                should display as they appear in OOM. Georeferenced OOM files are supported only if they use the UTM coordinate
                system (this restriction may be relaxed in the final version).
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>Course Variations and Relays</strong></p>
            <p>
                You can now add forks or loops into courses, creating courses with variations. For example, a course might have
                two 2-way forks in a row, allowing four possible ways through the course. Each course variation is identified
                with a letter code that identifies which forks are taken. In the previous example, "AD" would indication that
                choice A is taken at the first fork, and choice D at the second fork. In order to view the variations more easily,
                the left side of the Purple Pen display (that normally shows the control descriptions), can be switched to show the
                control ordering, with forks displayed. Controls can be dragged around the ordering, and controls and legs can be
                easily selected for adding new controls. In order to create a variation, select a control, then click "Add Variation"
                on the toolbar. You can chose whether to add a fork or loop, and how many branches to create.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have a course with variations, Purple Pen can automatically assign variations to relay team members.
                Chose "Relay Team Variations" from the Course menu, and chose how many legs and teams you have. You can later
                add more teams without disrupting the assignments of existing teams, as long as the number and arrangement of
                forks doesn't change.
            </p>
            <p>
                When printing (courses, description sheets, punch cards), you can chose which variations or teams to print.
                Click on the course with the variation, and click "Select Variations..." to chose variations for that course.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>Better PDF Files</strong></p>
            <p>
                When using a PDF file as the base map for course design, Purple Pen no longer requires the download of
                GPL Ghostscript for reading PDF files. Purple Pen now has built in support for reading PDFs, based on the
                open source PDFium project used by Google Chrome. Compatibility is much better, especially for PDFs
                produced by OCAD.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>User Interface Changes</strong></p>
            <p>
                The Item menu has been reorganized, and the entries that add items have been moved to a new "Add" menu.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 2.6.2</h2>

            <p>
                IOF XML export (both versions 2 and 3) now output real-world coordinates of controls
                when used with a geo-referenced OCAD map.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                New support for text control descriptions to enable languages such as Polish to include nouns that change case
                based on modifiers in other columns.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bug fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Ghostscript version updated to 9.16. This will require a re-download and install of Ghostscript when
            using PDF maps.
        </li>
        <li>
            In IOF XML export, sometime the wrong decimal separator was used for decimal numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixed appearance when running on high-DPI displays (such as Surface 4).

    <h2>Changes in 2.6.0</h2>
    <h3>New features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Supports the OCAD 12 file format. Purple Pen can load map files in the OCAD 12 file format, and can
                also export to the OCAD 12 file format. However, new symbol types only in OCAD 12 are not yet supported. These
                symbol features are rarely, if ever, used in orienteering maps, so this should not be a significant
                issue. If you do use these features, a warning message will appear when loading the file, and also
                when printing or exporting a PDF.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The handling of print areas, paper sizes, and orientation (landscape/portrait) has been substantially
                redone in order to make it simpler to use. Instead of setting the paper size when printing or creating
                a PDF, you now set the paper size when creating a new event, or when using the File/Set Print Area
                command. You can set different paper sizes for different courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The print area can now be viewed all the time using the View/Show Print Area command. When changing
                the print area, you can now have the print area fixed to be the same as the page size, which greatly
                simplifies setting the print area. Also, there is an automatic setting which automatically choses
                the print area based on the map and the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                When loading files created in a previous version of Purple Pen, you should check the
                paper size and make sure it is set correctly.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                A new option is present on the Event/Customize Appearance dialog: Use overprint effect for
                colors marked overprint. On an OCAD map, this causes Purple Pen to use the overprinting effect
                when printing (or creating a PDF) for colors in the color table that request it.
                This is off by default. If you don't know what this means, you probably want to leave it off.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                When adding textual lines in the middle of a description using "Item/Add Text Line", you can now

                On the "Event/Customize Description Text" dialog, there is now an option for "Make this the default

                for textual control descriptions on new events.

        <li>
            <p>
                If the "White outline around numbers" options was used, and a PDF was created, the number "11"
                in had the white outline on the second "1" offset. This was due to different kerning rules being
                used for the control number and the outline. This is now fixed.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                OCAD 11 changed the way that dashed lines were drawn, then in OCAD 11.5.4 added the
                View/Line Objects Appearance as in OCAD 10. Purple Pen now respects both options when drawing
                dashed lines. (Thanks to Mark Roberts for noticing this.)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                In rare cases Purple Pen would draw fences and similar features with corner points different
                than OCAD. (Thanks for Mark Roberts for noticing this.)

                When loading bitmaps used as background maps, Purple Pen would lock the files so that OCAD could not

                When using PDF files that used to produce the error "Cannot handle iref streams", Purple Pen

                When a control that is shared between multiple courses is moved, a dialog now comes up asking if
                you want to move that control is all courses, or create a new control (thereby not changing the other
                courses.) This does not occur if you move a control on the All Controls display, or move a control less
                than 50 meters. This helps a common confusion, especially among beginners.

        <li>
            <p>
                After deleting a control, the control that preceded it is selected. This makes it easier to add a new

            <p>
                Add the ability to blend the purple color of courses with the underlying map, so that dark and
                black objects show through the purple color. (This is sometime called overprinting.) This is turned
                on by default when creating a new Purple Pen file. You can turn this on and off by choosing
                Event/Customize Course Appearance, and checking the "blend purple with underlying map colors".

                Purple blending works in the on screen display, printing, and PDF file creation. When exporting
                to OCAD, the purple color has the "overprinting" option turned on.

                the control locations that you can download to your GPS device (or smartphone). When setting courses
                this can help double check that the control location is correct.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add the "Add Special Item/Image" command. This allows adding a bitmap image (in either
                BMP, JPEG, PNG, GIF, or TIFF format to a map. This is useful for adding sponsor logos
                and other bitmaps to a map. NOTE: If you add an image object, your Purple Pen file
                cannot be loaded by earlier versions of Purple Pen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add the "Add Special Item/Line" and "Add Special Item/Rectangle" commands. These allow adding
                a series or line segments or a rectangle to the map. The color and width of the line can
                be set, and lines can be single, double, or dashed. NOTE: If you add a line or rectangle object,
                your Purple Pen file cannot be loaded by earlier versions of Purple Pen.

                Create vector PDF files directly from the program, without having to use a PDF print driver or OCAD. Uses the CMYK color space for the PDF files, if desired. If

                Full support for map exchanges. You can add a map exchange either at a control, or with a
                flagged route to a map exchange point. Purple Pen allows you to view either parts of the course,
                or the entire course, and creates partial or full control descriptions, as appropriate. You can
                set a different print area for each part of a course with a map exchange, although all
                parts must be on the same map file.

                When you hover over a control or leg on the map, a small popup appears with information
                about the control or leg. This can be turned on or off with the "View/Show Popup Information" menu item.

                On Windows Vista and later, printing has been completely revamped to use a vector-based printing model. This should
                result in smaller spool files, faster printing, and better PDF creation when used with a
                PDF print driver. You can switch back to the old method (in case of problems) by
                checking the "Rasterize Before Printing" check box in the Print Courses dialog. (On Windows XP,
                the Rasterize Before Printing option is always on and cannot be disabled).

                The program now uses the "CMYK" (cyan-magenta-yellow-black) color model by default
                when printing or displaying on the screen. This should mean that maps print with colors
                much closer to what the map creator intended, and similar to how OCAD prints them on a
                PostScript printer. When printing, you now have the option of using the "CMYK" color
                model (the new default), the “RGB” printing model (how Purple Pen 1.x did it), or "OCAD Compatible".
                The "OCAD Compatible" model should produce the same output as OCAD does on the same printer.

                Gaps in control circles are now much better and more like gaps in a leg. You can drag a gap of any
                size and adjust the size of a gap after it is created. You can now add a small (2mm) gap in a leg by just
                clicking after selecting the add gap command.

                By default, when printing the map is cropped to fit on
                a single page. In most cases, this means you don&#39;t have to set the print
                area manually, since Purple Pen intelligently crops to fit the course best
                on the page. If you want you can still print a map across multiple pages.

                The AltGr key on some keyboards now works correctly
                when directly editing the title of an event or the dimensions in column F. Also,
                if you enter text here and then click outside the popup without pressing Enter,
                the entered text is used instead of discarded.

    <h3>New Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                OCAD compatibility has been completed (to my knowledge). All OCAD symbols and options
                should print and display correctly.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                New command "Delete Unused Controls" on the Event menu allows easily deleting all controls
                in the All Controls collection that are not being used by any course.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                New Event Audit report checks and reports on many possible problems, including unused controls,
                missing descriptions, controls less than 100m apart, missing punch patterns, and more.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                It is now possible to move control codes on the All
                Controls display. To prevent errors, they must still be directly adjacent to
                the associated circle.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                English description text is phrased better. Instead
                of &quot;knoll, rocky, E side&quot;, you get &quot;E side of rocky knoll&quot;.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                Control gaps are now maintained separately for each
                print scale. So if one course is at 1:15,000 and another is at 1:10,000,
                then different gaps can be placed in the same control circle.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                Create OCAD Files now allows placing a prefix before
                the course name for each file generated. Also, if files will be replaced,
                you are warned about them.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                When creating a new event, you are now prompted for
                the default printing scale. This becomes the printing scale for All Controls
                as well as the default scale for new courses.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                You can change the print scale for All Controls by
                choosing Course/Properties when the All Controls map is displayed. This
                affects the size of circles on the All Controls map, as well as the scale
                when printing the All Controls map.

    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                On some printers, dashed lines (such as paths) would
                print without the dashes. On some printers, patterned areas like indistinct
                marshes might print partially in the wrong color. These are fixed.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                If a leg had bends or gaps in it, and one of the controls on the end was deleted, an internal
                error could occur due to inconsistent data. This is fixed.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">Control codes that are a single letter or digit are now allowed.</p>

                When creating OCAD files, characters in the course
                name that are not allowed in file names are now correctly handled.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                Very occasionally on a few maps with short dry ditch
                symbols, an OutOfMemoryException would occur at certain zoom levels. This should be
                fixed now.

    <h3>New Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                OCAD compatibility has been vastly enhanced. Almost
                all OCAD symbols and options print and display correctly. The warning
                message that used to display before printing courses has been removed,
                because printing courses directly from Purple Pen now works correctly in
                virtually all cases. In the cases where the OCAD map contains a symbol that
                will not print correctly, Purple Pen detects in and displays a message
                before printing indicating which symbol is affected.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                The menus have been somewhat rearranged to make the
                layout more logical and make commands easier to find. In particular, there
                are two new menus. The Event menu contains commands that affect the entire
                event. The Item menu contains commands that affect the currently selected
                item (control, start, finish, leg, special item). Other small changes have
                occurred also.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                The new Item/Add Text Line command can be used to add
                an arbitrary text line anywhere in the description sheet.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                The Create XML Interface File command has been
                renamed Create E-Punch Interface File to reflect its primary usage.
            </p>

        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                The Add Gap and Add Bend commands have toolbar
                buttons and keyboard shortcuts for them.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                New command: Event/Map File, which allows changing the associated map file
                after the event is created.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                If the map file cannot be found when the Purple Pen file is opened, a useful
                error message is shown and the user is prompted to find the map file.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                Map files can now be bitmap files as well as OCAD files. The supported bitmap
                file formats are TIFF, JPEG, BMP, GIF, and PNG. When you export courses to OCAD,
                the bitmap becomes a template (background map) for the OCAD course.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                If an OCAD map file contains a font that is not
                installed on the current computer, the user is warned about this when the
                event is loaded. If desired, the warning can then be turned off for the
                event.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                Based on feedback, the control descriptions on the map now appear in black
                (previously they appeared in purple).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                Added &quot;Leg Lengths&quot; report to the Reports menu. This shows the lengths of
                each leg on each course, as well as the average leg length for each course.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                Added &quot;Customize Descriptions&quot; to the Controls menu. This dialog allows you
                to change the English text associated with any of the symbols. This is
                especially useful for the special item symbols. You can also add a key at the
                bottom of description to show what the special item symbols denote.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                The order of courses can be specified by using the Course/Course Order
                command. By default, courses are displayed in the order in which you added them
                (instead of alphabetically as before).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                When adding a new control, if no control or leg is
                selected, the control is inserted in the nearest leg (instead of at the end
                of the course). When adding a new control, or moving a control, the
                connecting leg lines are shown to provide better feedback as to what will
                happen.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                When adding a new control to a course, a control
                already in the existing course can be chosen, so that butterfly-style
                courses can be easily created.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                The &quot;abbreviate in text&quot; option for printing control
                descriptions has been removed, as it added complexity with minimal benefit.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                A new &quot;Clear Selection&quot; command (keyboard shortcut:
                Esc) clears the selection on the current course. Clicking on nothing
                accomplishes the same thing.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="featurelist">
                When starting Purple Pen, a new option allows loading
                the sample event, so people using the program for the first time can get a
                sense of how it works. This file also is placed in a different location on
                install.

                32x32 icon was empty. Now the correct Purple Pen icon
                is there -- used for desktop shortcuts, for example. You may need to rebuild
