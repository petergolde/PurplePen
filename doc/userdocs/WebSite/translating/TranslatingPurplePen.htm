<h1>Translating Purple Pen</h1>
<p>Thank you for being interested in translating Purple Pen into a new language. 
By translating Purple Pen, you open up its use to a vast number of people who 
would be unable or unwilling to use it in English.</p>
<p>There are two separate kinds of translations for Purple Pen, which are 
handled in different ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Translating textual control descriptions</h2>
<p>First, translations can be entered for all of the symbols used on a control 
description sheet, so that textual control descriptions can be automatically 
generated. This requires that translations be entered for each of the control 
description symbols, such as &quot;hill&quot;, &quot;reentrant&quot;, &quot;rocky&quot;, &quot;N side of&quot;, etc. 
Once this is complete, textual control descriptions can be generated for that 
language. This is a job that one person with good knowledge of orienteering 
terminology in their chosen language can do in a few hours.
<a href="TranslatingSymbolicDescriptions.htm">Detailed instructions for doing 
this are here.</a></p>
<p>In order to prevent duplicate work, please email
<a href="mailto:peter@golde.org">peter@golde.org</a> if you plan to translate 
textual control descriptions. I will note languages that are completed or in 
progress on this page. Current languages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>English (complete)</li>
    <li>English -- UK (complete)</li>
	<li>French (complete)</li>
	<li>Swedish (complete)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Translating the program user interface</h2>
<p>Second, the user interface for the program can be translated. This involves 
translating all the text in the menus, windows, reports, and so forth (currently 
around 600 different pieces of text). Because this is a big task, and because 
new text is being added as new features appear, this can be done incrementally 
and collaboratively. You can do just a few pieces of text or many, or review and 
correct what other people have done. <a href="TranslatingUserInterface.htm">
Detailed instructions for doing this are here.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Completed translations will be incorporated into future releases of Purple 
Pen.</p>
<p>Please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:peter@golde.org">
peter@golde.org</a> if you have any questions as to how to proceed with the 
translation. It can be confusing at times, so please don&#39;t hesitate to ask 
questions.</p>
