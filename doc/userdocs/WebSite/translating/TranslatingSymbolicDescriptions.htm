<h1>Translating Symbolic Descriptions</h1>
<p>To translate the symbolic descriptions, you use some hidden commands in 
Purple Pen.</p>
<p>Once you have installed your new version of Purple Pen, run it and open the 
sample event. </p>
<p><strong>Windows Vista / Windows 7 only: </strong>You must be running Purple Pen as an 
Administrator in order to translate the symbolic description. To do this on 
Windows Vista:</p>
<ul>
	<li>On the start menu, open &quot;All Programs&quot;, then &quot;Accessories&quot;, the <em>
	right-click</em> on &quot;Command Prompt&quot;. From the right-click menu, choose &quot;Run 
	As Adminstrator&quot;.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Confirm the User Account Control dialog by clicking Continue.</li>
	<li>In the command prompt, type &quot;<span class="style1"><strong>cd C:\Program 
	Files\Purple Pen</strong></span>&quot;.</li>
	<li>To start Purple Pen, type &quot;<span class="style1"><strong>PurplePen</strong></span>&quot; in the command prompt. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessing the translation menu</h2>
<p>To begin translation, <em>hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys 
simultaneously</em>, and open the Help menu. A special sub-menu called &quot;Translate 
Description Texts&quot; is available only if Ctrl and Shift are both held down. </p>
<p><img alt="screenshot 1" src="screenshot1.png" width="557" height="402" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Adding a new language</h2>
<p>Select the &quot;Add Description Language...&quot; menu item. A dialog window appears 
to get information about the language that you wish to translate to.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot 2" src="screenshot2.png" width="352" height="266" /></p>
<p>In the new language drop-down, select the language that you wish to translate 
to.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Native language name&quot; text area, type the name of the language, in 
that language. This will be automatically filled in for you; correct it if you 
like or leave it alone.</p>
<p>The rest of the dialog needs to be filled out with information that helps 
Purple Pen create grammatically correct descriptions. In order to get good 
quality descriptions, you must fill these out correctly for your language. They 
works as follows:</p>
<h3>Use plural nouns for between/junction/crossing</h3>
<p>This setting is used when the between, junction, or crossing symbols are 
used, and the same symbol is used for both objects. For example:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot 3" src="screenshot3.png" width="233" height="32" /></p>
<p>In many languages, it may produce a better description to use a plural form 
of the symbol in column D. For example, in English, this description would be 
&quot;between <em>boulders</em>&quot;. If you check this box, then you can and should 
define a plural form of each symbol that can appear in column D. If you leave 
this unchecked, then only singular forms of symbols can be entered.</p>
<h3>Use plural adjectives for plural nouns</h3>
<p>This setting is only significant when the between, junction, or crossing 
symbol are used, plural nouns (above) are used, and a descriptive symbol 
(shallow, rocky, ruined, ...) is present in column E. For example:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot 4" src="screenshot4.png" width="234" height="30" /></p>
<p>In English, this would be &quot;between <em>rocky</em> hills&quot;. In English, the 
word &quot;rocky&quot; does not change form whether it is modifying &quot;hill&quot; or &quot;hills&quot;. 
However, in some languages (French, for example), the form of the adjective may 
change depending on whether it modifies a plural or singular word (une colline
<em>rocheuse</em><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:
minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"> </span>vs. des collines <em>rocheuses</em>). If this is the case for the 
language you are translating to, check the box.</p>
<p>If you check this box, then you can and should define a plural form of each 
symbol that can appear in column E. </p>
<h3>Adjectives change based on gender of noun being modified</h3>
<p>In some languages other than English, each noun belongs to a particular 
gender, and adjectives change their form depending on the gender of the noun. If 
this is the case in the language you are translating, check this box. If you 
check this, for each symbol that can appear in column D, you should set the 
gender of that word. For adjectives and descriptive phrases that can appear in 
columns C, E, and G, you can enter different forms for each gender, if 
necessary.</p>
<p>If you check this box, you must fill in a list of genders (separated by 
commas) in the text box below.</p>
<p>So, for example, for French, the dialog would be filled out as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot 5" src="screenshot5.png" width="352" height="266" /></p>
<p>Once you press OK, your new language is added. It is initialized with the 
English text for each symbol.</p>
<h2>Entering translated text for symbols</h2>
<p>Again, hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys simultaneously, and open the Help 
menu. Select &quot;Add Translated Texts...&quot; from the &quot;Translate Description Texts&quot; 
sub-menu.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot 6" src="screenshot6.png" width="544" height="496" /> </p>

<p>The left hand side shows all of the symbols that need translation. On the 
right hand side shows the current entered translations. At first, each symbol is 
initialized with the English version of the text for that symbol. There are two 
different translation for each symbol -- the symbol text and the symbol name. 
Often they are the same (except the symbol name is capitalized, but sometimes 
they are different. The <strong>Name</strong> of the symbol shows up at the 
bottom of the popup symbol chooser when choosing a symbol. The text is used when 
constructing the textual description for the control. In some cases, the name is 
a longer or more descriptive for that the text. For example, the name of the 
symbol in English is &quot;North-east edge&quot;, but the text is &quot;NE edge&quot;.</p>
<p>To change the name of the symbol, just type in the text box under &quot;Symbol 
name:&quot;. To change the description text for the symbol, click the button &quot;Change 
text...&quot;. When you click this button, you get an additional window that allows 
you to enter the text for the symbol, possibly included plural or gender forms. 
For example:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot 7" src="screenshot7.png" width="490" height="364" /></p>
<p>In this window, enter the text in the last column of the grid. If applicable, 
be sure to set the gender of the word in the dropdown at the bottom of the 
window.</p>
<p>See the Appendix for information with detailed information about different 
symbol types and how they are combined to make the full textual description.</p>
<h2>Checking your translations</h2>
<p>After entering translations, it is a good idea to return the main program and 
test out different descriptions to look at the text forms, to make sure that 
your translations combine in a reasonable grammatical way. When any control is 
selected, the text version is show in the selected object pane, right below the 
description sheet. You may need to enlarge the pane to see it.</p>

<h2>Submitting your translations</h2>
<p>Once you are happy with the translations, email the file &quot;<a href="file:///C:/Program%20Files/Purple%20Pen/symbols.xml">C:\Program 
Files\Purple Pen\symbols.xml</a>&quot; to <a href="mailto:peter@golde.org">
peter@golde.org</a>. I will incorporate the translation in the next release of 
Purple Pen, and make sure that no one else does the same translation.</p>
<h2>Asking for help</h2>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to email
<a href="mailto:peter@golde.org">peter@golde.org</a> with any questions.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Symbol types</h2>
<p>While the symbols that appear in column D (Control feature) are fairly 
straightforward, other symbols are somewhat more complex. Many symbols use <em>
replaceable text</em>, which is replaced with actual text when the description 
is being created. Replacable text appears as either the text &quot;{0}&quot; or &quot;{1}&quot;. The 
usage of replaceable text differs depending on the type of symbol.</p>
<p>When constructing the description, Purple Pen always uses the text from 
symbols in the following order:</p>
<p>Column D (control feature)<br />
Column E (appearance)<br />
crossing or junction in column F<br />
between in column G<br />
size in column F<br />
Column C (which of any similar feature)<br />
Column G (location of control)<br />
Column H (other information)</p>
<h3>Column E symbols (Appearance)</h3>
<p>The text for these symbols uses the replaceable text &quot;{0}&quot;. When the 
description is being constructed, {0} is replaced with the text for the column D 
symbol that is being described. This allows the text to either precede or follow 
the symbol being described, as needed by the language. For example, in English 
the text for rocky is &quot;rocky {0}&quot;, so a rocky hill is described as &quot;rocky hill&quot;. 
If the text were changed to &quot;{0} that is covered with rocks&quot;, then a rocky hill 
would be described as &quot;hill that is covered with rocks&quot;.</p>
<h3>Column C and G symbols, except crossing (which of any similar feature, 
location of control)</h3>
<p>The text for these symbols uses the replaceable text &quot;{0}&quot;. When the 
description is being constructed {0} is replaced with the text for the feature. 
If both a column C and column G symbol is present, the column C symbol is 
processed first. For example, the text for &quot;Nothern&quot; (column C) is &quot;N {0}&quot;, and 
text for &quot;Eastern edge&quot; is &quot;E edge of {0}&quot;. Thus the text for:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot 8" src="screenshot8.png" width="234" height="30" /></p>
<p>is processed in the following order: </p>
<p>column D = &quot;clearing&quot; --&gt; &quot;clearing&quot;<br />
column C = &quot;N {0}&quot; --&gt; &quot;N clearing&quot;<br />
column G = &quot;E edge of {0}&quot; --&gt; &quot;E edge of N clearing&quot;</p>
<p>resulting in a complete description of &quot;E edge of N clearing&quot;.</p>
<h3>Crossing, Junction, and Between</h3>
<p>These three symbols are handled in special ways, because they involve 
combining two different other symbols. Each of these symbols is actually two 
different symbols internally, with different texts.</p>
<p>The first form of this symbol is used when two different control features are 
used in columns D and E. These three symbols are called &quot;Crossing&quot;, &quot;Junction&quot;, 
and &quot;Between&quot;. For these symbols, the replacable text &quot;{0}&quot; is replaced with the 
first control feature, and the replaceable text &quot;{1}&quot; is replaced with the 
second control feature. The text for these symbols should contain both {0} and 
{1}.</p>
<p>The second form of this symbol is used when the same control feature is used 
in column D and E, or when column E is blank or an appearance symbol. These 
three symbols are called &quot;Crossing (objects of same kind)&quot;, &quot;Junction&nbsp; 
(objects of same kind)&quot;, and &quot;Between&nbsp; (objects of same kind)&quot;. They do not 
have pictures next to the in the list. For these symbols, the replacable text 
&quot;{0}&quot; is replaced with the singular form of the control feature, and &quot;{1}&quot; is 
replaced with the plural form of the control feature. The text should contain 
exactly one of {0} and {1}.</p>
<p>Examples in English:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot 9" src="screenshot9.png" width="233" height="148" /></p>
<p><strong>Control 33:<br />
</strong>column D = singular &quot;boulder&quot; / plural &quot;boulders&quot;<br />
column E = singular &quot;boulder&quot; / plural &quot;boulders&quot;<br />
column G (objects of same kind) = &quot;between {1}&quot; --&gt; &quot;between boulders&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Control 34:<br />
</strong>column D = singular &quot;boulder&quot;<br />
column E = singular &quot;knoll&quot;<br />
column G = &quot;between {0} and {1}&quot; --&gt; &quot;between boulder and knoll&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Control 35:<br />
</strong>column D = &quot;path&quot;<br />
column E = &quot;stream&quot;<br />
column F = &quot;{0} and {1} crossing&quot; --&gt; &quot;path and stream crossing&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Control 36:<br />
</strong>column D = singular &quot;knoll&quot; / plural &quot;knolls&quot;<br />
column E = &quot;rocky {0}&quot; --&gt; singular &quot;rocky knoll&quot; / plural &quot;rocky knolls&quot;<br />
column G = &quot;between {1}&quot; --&gt; &quot;between rocky knolls&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Control 37:<br />
</strong>column D = singular &quot;path&quot; / plural &quot;paths&quot;<br />
column E = &quot;singular &quot;path&quot; / plural &quot;paths&quot;<br />
column F (objects of same kind) = singular &quot;{0} crossing&quot; / plural &quot;{0} 
crossings&quot; --&gt; singular &quot;path crossing&quot; / plural &quot;path crossings&quot;<br />
column G (objects of same kind) = &quot;between {1}&quot; -&gt; &quot;between path crossings&quot;</p>
<h3>Size of feature in Column F</h3>
<p>There are several different &quot;symbols&quot; that affect how size numbers in column 
F are translated into text. The following describes the purpose of each of these 
symbols:</p>
<p>&quot;Height of feature&quot;:&nbsp; used when column F is a simple number, such as 
&quot;5&quot;, which describes how high the main feature is (e.g., a boulder). The special 
text {0} is replaced with the height in meters.</p>
<p>&quot;Depth of feature&quot;: used when column F is a simple number, such as &quot;5&quot;, which 
describes how deep the main feature is (e.g., a pit). The special text {0} is 
replaced with the depth in meters.</p>
<p>&quot;Size of feature&quot;: used when column F has two numbers separated by an &quot;x&quot;, 
such as &quot;5x8&quot;, which describes the size of the feature (e.g., a clearing). The 
special text {0} is replaced with the first length, and the special text {1} is 
replaced by the second length.</p>
<p>&quot;Height of feature on slope&quot;: used when column F is two numbers separated by 
a slash, such as &quot;1/3&quot;, which describes the height of a feature on a slope. The 
special text {0} is replaced with the first height, and the special text {1} is 
replaced by the second height.</p>
<p>&quot;Depth of feature on slope&quot;: used when column F is two numbers separated by a 
slash, such as &quot;1/3&quot;, used with a feature that is deep rather than high. The 
special text {0} is replaced with the first height, and the special text {1} is 
replaced by the second height.</p>
<p>&quot;Size of two features&quot;: used when column F describes the sizes of two 
different main features, one above the other (entered in Purple Pen using a 
&quot;|&quot;). The special text {0} is replaced with the first size, and {1} with the 
second size. In this case, the {0} and {1} texts are those formed by one of the 
other size symbol textgs.</p>
<h3>Special directives with distances (finish, flagged routes)</h3>
<p>There are symbols for the various special directive that span all eight boxed 
(the pictures look kind of squished in the translation window!) The directives 
for finishes, marked routes, and finishes have special text {0} which is 
replaced with the appropriate distance, <em>plus a space</em>. Thus the {0} 
should be right in front of the next word, without any space. For example, the 
finish symbol without tapes in English is &quot;navigate {0}to finish&quot;, with no space 
between &quot;{0}&quot; and &quot;to&quot;.</p>
<h3>Other special symbols</h3>
<p>A few other special &quot;symbols&quot; (which do not have actual graphics symbols) are 
used for a few pieces of text that appear in descriptions, as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Course length&quot; --&gt; describes the course statistics, when the course has no 
climb. {0} is replaced with the length</p>
<p>&quot;Course length and climb&quot; --&gt; describes the course statistics, when the 
course has climb. {0} is replaced with the length, {1} with the climb.</p>
<p>&quot;Number of Controls&quot; --&gt; used in the all controls description sheet to show 
the number of controls. {0} is replaced with the number of controls.</p>
<p>&quot;Number of Points&quot; --&gt; used in score course description sheet to show the 
total number of points. {0} is replaced with the number of points.</p>
<p>&quot;And&quot; --&gt; used when two features are placed in column D and E, but without 
the crossing, between, or junction symbols being used. This is non-standard, but 
occasionally used. {0} is replaced with the first feature, {1} with the second 
feature.</p>
