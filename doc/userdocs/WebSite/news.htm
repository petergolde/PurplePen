<p class="style1">Beta 2 of Purple Pen has finally been released. The main new features 
are listed in the new item below. You can see <a href="change_summary.htm">the full list of changes and fixes 
here</a>.</p>
<p class="style1">I hope that the new version works well for many of you. As 
always, please let me know what fixed and features you would like to see in the 
future.</p>
<h2>February 26, 2008</h2>
<p class="style1">Work continues on Beta 2 of Purple Pen. Hopefully it can be released in March. Stay tuned!</p>
<p class="style1">Here are a few of the new features that will be in Beta 2:</p>
<ul class="style2">
	<li>You can easily change the map file associated with an event. Also, if 
	the map file cannot be found when an event is opened, PP kindly asks you to 
	find the map file.</li>
	<li>A JPEG, TIFF, or BMP file can be used instead of an OCAD map for the map 
	file. You must specify the resolution of the bitmap and the scale of the map 
	manually in this case.</li>
	<li>A new report to show the lengths of all legs.</li>
	<li>Control descriptions on the map now appear in black instead of purple.</li>
	<li>You can customize the text associated with any description symbol. This 
	is especially useful for the special item symbols. You can also add a key at 
	the bottom of description to show what the special item symbols denote.</li>
	<li>Purple Pen now correctly displays and print almost all features just 
	like OCAD, so the Print Courses command now is recommended for use. For 
	those few features it doesn&#39;t support, PP will detect and warn you before 
	you print.</li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">Please keep the feedback coming! It is very useful in deciding 
what features are really needed.</p>
