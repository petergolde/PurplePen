<h1>File/Create RouteGadget Files...</h1>

<p>This command creates files for use in the RouteGadget route display program. RouteGadget is a web-based program that allows competitors to draw their 
routes on a copy of the map and compare them with other competitors. You can 
learn more about RouteGadget <a href="http://www.routegadget.net/">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.routegadget.co.uk/index/competitor/what-is-routegadget">here</a>.</p>
<p>RouteGadget requires uploading three files to the web site for an event: </p>
<ul>
	<li>A .gif file with an image of the map</li>
	<li>A .xml file that describes the locations of the controls and the courses</li>
	<li>A file from the timing program with split times for each competitor</li>
</ul>
<p>This command automatically creates the first two files. After the event is 
complete, you must obtain the timing program output before posting the event to 
Route Gadget.</p>
<p>When creating the image of the map, Purple Pen automatically creates a map 
image of the appropriate resolution that encloses all the courses.</p>

<p>This dialog has several options to customize the result.</p>
<h2>File Name section</h2>
<p>This section allows settng the file name (without the .xml or .gif extension) 
for the two files that are created. The default name is the name of the event.</p>
<h2>Folder section</h2>
<p>This section determines in which folder (directory) the RouteGadget files are 
created. There are three choices:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Same folder as Purple Pen file</strong>. The files are placed in 
	the same folder as the Purple Pen (.ppen) file for this event. This is the 
	default choice.</li>
	<li><strong>Same folder as map file</strong>. The files are placed in the 
	same folder as the map file for this event.</li>
	<li><strong>Other folder. </strong>Any other folder. If you chose this, a 
	&quot;Select Folder...&quot; button appears which you can click to select any folder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other buttons</h2>
<p><strong>Create</strong>: This button Creates the RouteGadget files. The dialog box closes.</p>
<p><strong>Cancel</strong>: Closes the dialog box without creating anything.</p>
