<h1>File/Create OCAD Files...</h1>

<p>This command creates OCAD files for each course that you specify. The OCAD 
file displays the course, overlaid on top of the map. This is most often used in 
order to print the courses, or do to further editing and customization which is 
beyond the abilities of Purple Pen. If you don&#39;t have a copy of OCAD, you can
<a href="http://www.ocad.com/en/downloads.htm">download the free OCAD version 6</a>.</p>
<p>For each course chosen, an OCAD file with the name of that course will be created. The file 
for that course contains the objects with the course, and references the map 
file as a template or background map. OCAD 6, however, does not have the ability 
to have another OCAD map as a template. When using OCAD 6, to view or print the 
course and the map, you must open the map file and import the course file.</p>

<p>This dialog has several options to customize the result.</p>
<h2>Courses section</h2>
<p>This section shows which courses will have OCAD files created. The default setting is for all courses except &quot;All Controls&quot; to be 
printed. Click the checkboxes next to the courses you wish to print. Click
<strong>All</strong> or <strong>None</strong> to quickly select or unselect all 
of the checkboxes at once.</p>
<p>For each course, an OCAD file with the name of the course is created.</p>
<h2>Output section</h2>
<p><strong>File format</strong>: This shows which file format will be used. For best results, chose 
the version of OCAD you will be used to load the files. </p>
<p><strong>File name prefix</strong>: If something is typed in here, it is 
prefixed onto the file name of each output file. For example, if you type 
&quot;Final&quot; in this box, then the result files would be &quot;Final-White.ocd&quot;, 
&quot;Final-Yellow.ocd&quot;, etc.</p>
<h2>Folder section</h2>
<p>This section determines in which folder (directory) the course files are 
created. There are three choices:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Same folder as Purple Pen file</strong>. The files are placed in 
	the same folder as the Purple Pen (.ppen) file for this event. This is the 
	default choice.</li>
	<li><strong>Same folder as map file</strong>. The files are placed in the 
	same folder as the OCAD map (.ocd) file for this event.</li>
	<li><strong>Other folder. </strong>Any other folder. If you chose this, a 
	&quot;Select Folder...&quot; button appears which you can click to select any folder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other buttons</h2>
<p><strong>Create</strong>: This button Creates the OCAD files. The dialog box closes.</p>
<p><strong>Cancel</strong>: Closes the dialog box without creating anything.</p>
