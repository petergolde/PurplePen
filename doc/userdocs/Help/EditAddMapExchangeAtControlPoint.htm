<h1>Item/Add Map Exchange/Map Exchange at Control Point</h1>
<p>Adds a map exchange directly at a control point. At the control point, competitors 
    pick up a new map that shows the remaining part of the course. The control point 
    where the map exchange is located appears on both parts of the map.</p>
<p>When this command is selected, all the controls in the control collection that are not already in the current course are shown in light purple on the current course map.</p>
<ul>
<li>To change a control that is already on the course into a map exchange control, click on that control circle.</li>
    <li>To add an existing control to the current course, and make it a map exchange control, click on the light purple existing control.</li>
<li>To add a new control to the current course, and make it a map exchange control, click elsewhere on the map. The new control is created with a code selected according to the <a href="ControlsAutomaticNumbering.htm">automatic numbering</a> settings.</li>
</ul>


    <p>Once you have added a map exchange, <a href="UsingMapExchanges.htm">the editing window allows switching between parts of the course</a>.</p>
