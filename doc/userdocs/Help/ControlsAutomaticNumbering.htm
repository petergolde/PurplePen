<h1>Event/Automatic Numbering...</h1>
<p>Sets how Purple Pen automatically numbers control codes. Optionally, renumbers the codes of all existing controls.</p>
<p><img src="AutomaticNumbering.png"></p>
<p>Purple Pen automatically numbers newly created controls according the settings in this dialog.</p>
<p><b>Starting code.</b> This is the first code that is used. To meet IOF guidelines, this should be 31 or greater.</p>
<p><b>Disallow codes that could be read upside-down.</b> If this box is checked, control codes that read as a <I>different</I> control code upside-down are skipped. Example codes that would be skipped are 66, 89, 108, 119. Check this box if control codes could possibly be misread by competitors.</p>
<p><b>Apply these settings to newly created controls only.</b> If this option is selected, the codes of existing controls are not changed. Any newly created control will receive a unique control code chosed according to the previous options.</p>
<p><b>Renumber existing controls also.</b> If this option is selected, all the existing controls will receive new control codes, consecutively numbers according to the previous options. Newly created controls will also receive a unique control code chosed according to the previous options.</p>
<p>Regardless of the settings in this dialog, you can always change controls to have any desired code (including letters) by using the <a href="ControlsChangeCodes.htm">Controls/Change Codes</a> command.
