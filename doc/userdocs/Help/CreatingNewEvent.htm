<h1>Creating a new event</h1>
<p>When you first start Purple Pen, you have the choice of opening an existing 
event or creating a new one. If you want to just see how the program works, you 
can open an existing event and open the sample event that comes with Purple Pen. </p>
<p>However, once you have finished playing with the sample event, it is time to 
create your own event. Select &quot;Create a New Event...&quot; from the initial dialog 
and you will be asked a series of questions to gather the information for 
creating a new event.</p>
<h2>Event Title</h2>
<p>First, enter the event title. This should be a short, one line description of 
the event. It will appear as the first line on each control description sheet. 
It is also used as the file name for the event file. Once the event title is 
entered, click &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
<h2>Map File</h2>
<p>Your event must use an OCAD map file, a bitmap map file, or a PDF file. OCAD versions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are 
supported; for a bitmap, you can use TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PNG, or BMP formats. When 
possible, using an OCAD map usually produces the best results. Click the &quot;Choose map file...&quot; button and select the map file you 
will use. Purple Pen will immediately try to read the map file to make sure it 
is usable (if it isn&#39;t, an error message will appear). After you have chosen the 
map file successfully, click &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
<p>The map file is used every time Purple Pen loads the event. If you send the 
Purple Pen file to someone else, they must have a copy of the map file also to 
successfully load the event and view the map.</p>
<h2>Map Resolution and Scale</h2>
<p>If you use an OCAD map, Purple Pen automatically reads the scale from the 
map, and this step is skipped. </p>
<p>If you use a bitmap (JPEG, TIFF, etc) as your map, Purple Pen needs to know 
the bitmap resolution and the map scale in order to correctly calculate the 
lengths of courses, the sizes of controls circles, and so forth. Purple Pen 
attempts to read the bitmap resolution from the bitmap file, so this may already 
be set correctly, but you should check the value to be sure. The resolution is 
expressed in dots per inch -- the number of pixels in each inch of the printed 
map. The map scale indicates how the map relates in size to the real world. After 
typing in the bitmap resolution and scale, click &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
    <p>If you use a PDF file as your map, Purple Pen needs to know the map scale. This indicates how distances on the map related the real world, and it needed to calculate the lengths of courses. Generally this is shown on the map.</p>
<h2>Print Scale</h2>
<p>Next, chose the scale at which you wish to print your competition maps. Most 
of the time, this will be the same as the scale of the map, so unless you know 
want to print at a different scale, just click Next. (Note: when creating a new 
course, you will have the option to change the print scale, so you can have 
different scales for different courses.)</p>
<h2>Event File Location</h2>
<p>Next, choose the folder where the file that stores your event will be stored. 
Purple Pen events are stored in a file with the file extension &quot;.ppen&quot;. The name 
of the file will be the event title you chose previously.</p>
<p>You can chose to place the Purple Pen file in the same folder as the map 
file. Alternatively, you can explicitly select any folder on your computer. </p>
<h2>Control Numbering</h2>
<p>Purple Pen automatically numbers all newly created controls. Choose the 
starting control code you would like to use. It is very easy to change control 
codes afterward, so don&#39;t worry about this setting if you don&#39;t know what the 
codes will be for your event.</p>
<h2>Create Event</h2>
<p>You&#39;ve answered all the questions needed to create a new event. If you are 
happy with what you selected, click &quot;Finish&quot; and you can begin designing 
courses. If you want to change any responses, click &quot;Back&quot; to go back to any 
previous questions.</p>
