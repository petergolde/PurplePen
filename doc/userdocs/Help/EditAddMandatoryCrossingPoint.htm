<h1>Item/Add Special Item/Mandatory Crossing Point</h1>
<p>Adds a <em>mandatory</em> crossing point to a leg. Unlike optional crossing 
points, mandatory crossing points indicate the only safe or permitted place to 
cross a dangerous feature, such as a road or stream.
<p>Mandatory crossing points 
behave much like controls&mdash;they appear between two particular controls, 
with leg lines leading to the crossing point, and they have a separate line in 
the control description sheet to describe them. To insert a mandatory crossing 
point, select the leg into which the crossing point should be inserted. Chose 
the Edit/Add Special Item/Mandatory Crossing Point command, and click the mouse 
where the crossing point should be placed. Finally, chose the
<a href="EditRotate.htm">Item/Rotate</a> command and rotate the crossing point 
to the correct orientation.<p>Unlike an optional crossing point, a mandatory 
crossing point appears only on the course you add it to. If you wish it to 
appear on other courses, you must add it to each course that uses it.&nbsp;</p>
