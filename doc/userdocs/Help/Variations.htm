<h1>Variations and Relays</h1>
<h2>Overview of Variations</h2>
<p>Starting with version 3.0, Purple Pen supports courses with <strong>Variations.</strong></p>
<p>Variations are often used in relay courses, so that teams can race head-to-head with a mass start, but reduces the ability
of competitors to follow each other. Different team members run different variations, but as a whole each team runs the exactly same
set of legs. Variations (especially loop variations) can also be used in single-person races.
</p>
<p>The simplest form of variation is a <strong>fork</strong>. The following diagram shows the simplest possible fork, with two variations: </p>
<p><img src="Variation1.png" /></p>
<p>There are two possible ways through the course: A and B. Variation A visits controls 31, 48, 36, 38. Variation B visits controls 31, 40, 43, 38. In 
a two-person relay, one team can run variation A, then B, while another team runs variation B, then A.
</p>
<p>A more complex course can sequence two or more forks. This provides more possible ways throught the course. For example, consider the following course, with two forks:</p>
<p><img src="Variation2.png" /></p>
<p>There are four possible ways throught the course, which are designated by letter pairs of which branches to take. Variation AC 
visits 31, 48, 36, 38, 50, 39. Variation AD visits 31, 48, 36, 38, 49, 39. Variation BC visits 31, 40, 43, 38, 50, 39. Variation 
BD visits 31, 40, 43, 38, 49, 39.
</p>
<p>In a two person relay, the first leg can run any of the four variations, and the second leg runs
the opposite branches (e.g., the first leg runs BC, and the second leg runs AD). Each team runs branches A, B, C, and D
exactly once.
</p>
<p>More complex courses can be set up, included 3-way, 4-way, 5-way, etc. forks. It is even possible to 
put a fork within a branch of another fork.
</p>
<p>The other basic kind of variation is a <strong>loop.</strong></p>
<p>In a loop, the competitor returns back to one of the controls multiple times, making several loops.
A competitor can run the loops in any order. Here is an example of a 3-way loop:
</p>
<p><img src="Variation3.png" /></p>
<p>There are 6 possible orders to run this course in: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA. For example, Variation CAB runs the 
controls in the order: 31, 52, 43, 42, 31, 46, 33, 32, 31, 40, 32, 31, 35, 36. No matter which order the loops 
are run, the course is completely fair.</p>
<h2>Creating and Editing Variations in Purple Pen</h2>
<p>To create a course with variations, first insert the start and finish, and any fixed controls that should be on all variations. 
Then click on the control where the fork or loop should start, and click "Add Variation" from the toolbar.
</p>
<p>Once you create a fork or loop, the left hand pane will switch to displaying the <a href="ControlOrderingPane.htm">Course Ordering.</a>
You can use this to select different branches and insert controls on them.
</p>
<p>When working with a course that uses variations, you can switch between variations using the gray bar directly above
the map:</p>
<p><img src="CourseVariationsSwitcher.png" /></p>
<p>Using this, you can display any variation of the course, or "All Variations", which displays all variations together.</p>
<p>When printing (or exporting the courses to PDFs or OCAD files), you can select which variations that you wish to print. Select the course with variations (the name, not just the checkbox), then click the &quot;Variations&quot; button to select which variations to print.</p>

<h2>Assigning Variations to Relay Teams</h2>
<p>If you are holding a relay, you will wish to assign variations to team members so that every team runs
the exact same legs, and to vary the assignments to minimized the possibility of following. Purple Pen can help
by assigning course variations to teams in a fair, randomized manner. Simply choose the <a href="CourseRelayTeamVariations.htm">Course/Relay Team Variations</a> command,
and choose the number of teams and the number of legs on each team. Click "Assign Variations", and Purple Pen will
pick a fair distribution of variations.
