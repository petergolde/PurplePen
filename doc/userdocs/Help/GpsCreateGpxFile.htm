<h1>GPS/Create GPX File...</h1>

<p>Creates GPX file with the control locations for use on an portable GPS unit or smart phone.</p>
    <p>A GPX file is a standard file with GPS coordinates (waypoints) in it. The GPX file can be used with a portable GPS unit or smartphone to verify the locations of controls when setting them. Consult the documentation for your GPS unit to learn how to send GPX files to it.</p>
    <p>In order to create a GPX file, the map file must be an OCAD or OpenOrienteering Mapper file, and the file must be georeferenced. Georeferencing a map sets up a mapping between coordinates on the paper, and geographic coordinates on the earth. <a href="http://wiki.ocad.com/en.wiki/index.php?title=Create_a_New_Map#Georeference_the_Map">See more information about setting up a georeferenced map in OCAD</a>. Purple Pen supports most, but not all, coordinate systems that OCAD supports. Purple Pen does not support User Defined coordinate systems.</p>
    <p><strong>Important</strong>: Do not rely solely on GPS coordinate to place controls in the field! Competitors need to be able to navigate to the control location using only the map and compass, and it is the course setter&#39;s resposibility to ensure that the control is fairly set, that the control site is accurately mapped, and that the control site can be navigated to. GPS locations should be treated only as a double check to prevent errors.</p>

<p>This dialog has a few options to customize how the GPX File is created.</p>
<h2>Courses section</h2>
<p>This section shows which courses will be sent to the GPX files. All controls in the selected courses will be placed in the GPX files. Select &quot;All controls&quot; to transfer all controls. In addition to waypoints for the controls, a track in the GPX file will be created for each course.</p>
<h2>Waypoints section</h2>
    <p><strong>Name prefix</strong>: If something is typed in here, it is used to create the names of the waypoints. For example, if you have a control with code &quot;31&quot;, and type &quot;A&quot; as the name prefix, the waypoint name in the GPX file will be &quot;A31&quot;. If no name prefix is specified, the control code is used as the waypoint name.</p>
