descriptions can appear for a given course. Any existing control descriptions on 
a course are removed when adding new control descriptions.</p>
<p>To add the control descriptions, chose the Item/Add 
Descriptions command. Press and hold the mouse button at the desired upper-left 
corner. Drag the mouse down and to the right until the course descriptions are 
the desired size, then release the mouse button. Once the control descriptions 
are added, they can be moved around by dragging them with the mouse, or resized 
by dragging the &quot;handles&quot; that appear on the corners and sides when it is

<p>When control description are added onto a course, the control descriptions

in the same location on multiple courses, select the

command.</p>
<p>The control description can appear as a single column, or as multiple 
columns. To display control descriptions as multiple columns, just drag the left 
or right edge of the descriptions with the mouse to widen the descriptions until 
they display in multiple columns.</p>
<p>If you are displaying "All Parts" for a course with a map exchange, you 
cannot add a control description. You must select the part that you wish to add 
descriptions to, then add the descriptions to that part. If you wish the 
descriptions to appear in the same place in multiple parts, select the
<a href="EditChangeDisplayedCourses.htm">Item/Change Displayed Courses</a> 
command.</p>
<p>You can add descriptions to "All Controls". These descriptions show all the 
controls in the event.</p>
<p>The appearance of the control descriptions (symbols, text, or both) can be 
changed with the <a href="CourseProperties.htm">Course/Properties</a> command.
