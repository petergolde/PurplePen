<h1>Printing</h1>
<p>Once your courses are completely done, you will want to print out the final 
materials for your event.</p>
    <p>There are a few different ways to print your course maps. If you are picky about output, you may wish to experiment to see which method produces the best output with your printing equipment; printers, programs, and printer drivers often vary in subtle ways that are hard to predict.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Directly print courses using the <a href="FilePrintCourses.htm">Print Courses</a> command. This will directly print out your map with the courses drawn on top. In earlier versions, OCAD printing was recommended over direct printing from Purple Pen, but in version 2.0 and higher, Purple Pen prints as accurately as OCAD. Note that the &quot;Color Model&quot; and &quot;Rasterize Before Printing&quot; options may affect your output quality also.</li>
        <li>Use OCAD or OpenOrienteering Mapper to print out your courses. This can be useful if you wish to use OCAD/OOM for further editing. First, export the courses to OCAD/OOM using the <a href="FileCreateOcadFiles.htm">Create 
OCAD Files</a> command. This creates one OCAD file for each course. Then, load 
each file into OCAD/OOM and print it. You must have the original map file as well as the exported OCAD/OOM file.</li>
        <li>Create PDF files to print later or take to a printing shop. First, create PDF files using the <a href="FileCreatePdfFiles.htm">Create PDFs</a> command. You can then print the resulting PDF files on any printer or given them to a printer shop. When printing. be sure to print the PDF without any scaling applied (do not scale to the printable area).</li>
    </ul>
<p>You can print out the control descriptions for each course using the
<a href="FilePrintDescriptions.htm">Print Descriptions</a> command.</p>
<p>If you are using pin punching, print out master punch cards for use in 
control card checking using the <a href="FilePrintPunchCards.htm">Print Punch 
Cards</a> command.</p>
<p>Finally, you may wish to print out a <a href="ReportsCourseSummary.htm">
Course Summary</a> and <a href="ReportsControlCrossReference.htm">Control 
Cross-reference</a> report for reference during the event.</p>
